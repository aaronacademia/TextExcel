# TextExcel
This project serves as a less user-friendly, beginner version of Microsoft Excel or other spreadsheet softwares. 
There are many different classes to process different types of cells, but each "cell" class implement an interface.
The Spreadsheet class implements the Grid interface, and the SpreadsheetLocation class implements the Location interface.
The TextExcel class includes the main method and implements the Spreadsheet class which includes the method processCommand(), used in the main method with a loop. This class handles interactions with the user and updates the spreadsheet depending on the user's command.
This project shows my understanding of an intermediate level of Java programming such as understanding how to write code from pseudocode, how classes are connected throughout an inheritance tree, and producing methods that perform complex tasks with parameters.
Also included is a JPEG of the pseudocode used to write code for the project in the format of an inheritance tree.
